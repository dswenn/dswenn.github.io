Where do I belong?			

Do I belong in Austria? Japan? China? India? Or America?

It’s week five of India. I’m sitting here on my bed. And I’m asking myself this question. I’ve been to all these places yet sometimes it feels like I am nowhere. I’m floating in the space of the inbetween. What am I seeking for? Where am I going? Is my life a series of goings?
