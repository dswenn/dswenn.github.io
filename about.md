Hey there! My name is Donald. I am a senior studying materials science engineering at Columbia University. My passion is in intermediate technology with a focus on creating technology with extreme affordability. I envision creating products that can stretch the lower socioeconomic classes, enable better livelihoods, and minimize the social and environmental injustices that pertain to the respective localities. I attended a small liberal arts college before transferring to Columbia for engineering, my background is rooted in the axioms of physics (B.A. in physics), and I have developed my technical side through three research experiences, two being abroad. I am currently finishing up my last semester at engineering school and aiming to develop more experience in working with communities, human-centered design, and translating problem identification into tangible solutions.

This webpage is a home to both my thoughts, reflections, and my projects I worked on over the years. You may even find some poems scattered here and there. Feel free to get in touch with me at [ds3628@columbia.edu](mailto:ds3628@columbia.edu) for any questions or comments!
