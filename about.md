Hey there! My name is Donald. I have a dream of making as many people as happy as I can. Vague huh? I just graduated from Columbia University with a B.S. in materials science engineering. For the next two years, I'll be at Stanford pursuing the [Design Impact](https://designimpact.stanford.edu/) track.

I attended a lifechanging small liberal arts college in Oregon prior to Columbia. My background is rooted in the axioms of physics (B.A. in physics), and I have developed my technical side through three research experiences, two being abroad. I've also spent time in Morocco & India working with communities and infrastructure.

My work currently focuses around organizational design, regeneration in relation to climate change, ethnography, needfinding, human-centered design, and large scale bottom up community and top down mobilization. I'm here to make a critical dent!

This webpage has been a home to my thoughts, reflections, and even some poetry over the years. Recently, a projects page was added and the website overhauled. Feel free to get in touch with me at [dswen@stanford.edu](mailto:dswen@stanford.edu) for any questions or comments!
