Hey there! My name is Donald. I just graduated from Columbia University with a B.S. in materials science engineering. My passion is in intermediate technology with a focus on creating technology with extreme affordability. I envision creating products that can stretch the lower socioeconomic classes, enable better livelihoods, and minimize the social and environmental injustices that pertain to the respective localities. I attended a small liberal arts college before transferring to Columbia for engineering, my background is rooted in the axioms of physics (B.A. in physics), and I have developed my technical side through three research experiences, two being abroad. I'm currently aiming to work with communities, practice human-centered design, and translate problem identification into tangible solutions.

This webpage has been a home to my thoughts, reflections, and even some poetry over the years. Recently, a projects page was added and the website overhauled. Feel free to get in touch with me at [ds3628@columbia.edu](mailto:ds3628@columbia.edu) for any questions or comments!
