> "What is the meaning of home to you? What is the one essential ingredient of home?"

In 2016, I led an alternative social justice oriented spring break trip for 14 undergraduates with my friend Emma Robinson in the city of Seattle. 


In preparation for the trip, I co-prepared a booklet for the students, holding weekly meetings leading up to the trip.
