Thermoelectrics are materials that generate electricity using a heat gradient.

In the summer of 2014, I spent 12 weeks researching flexible thermoelectric fabrics at Louisiana State University through a research experience for undergraduates (REU) sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Under the guidance of Dr. David P Young, I incorporated thermoelectric nanoparticles into a polymer and a graphene matrix.

For the polymer matrix, I drop casted bismuth telluride nanoparticles onto a polymer substrate called PVDF and let it bake overnight at 60 C. Using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), I took images of how the nanoparticles rested in the substrate.

These fabrics can be worn and used to charge a phone.

In addition, I worked with Dr. Young to incorporate thermoelectric nanoparticles into a graphene matrix. Graphene is known to be a conductor and if graphene could serve as a matrix, holding thermoelectric nanoparticles, then the thermoelectric performance could increase significantly.

Using the laser from a DVD drive/burner, I etched a pattern of graphene on top of a CD disc coated with a layer of graphite oxide and bismith telluride nanoparticles. We tested the figure of merit using LabView and imaged using SEM.

The experience taught me to synthesize crystals using furnaces, image using the SEM, and how to carry out a research project with only little guidance. The presentation poster for this project can be downloaded [here]("dswenn.com/assets/files/final_poster.pdf").
