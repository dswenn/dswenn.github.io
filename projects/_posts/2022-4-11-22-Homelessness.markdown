## Project Summary
A digital kiosk system that replaces a paper binder sign in/sign out system. Staff have a user interface to better track and manage the safety and well-being of their clients. Clients have more privacy than a paper binder where others can see if they have signed in or not.

## Motivation
Growing up in the Bay Area, we've all noticed the increase in the homelessness population. I remember when I was young, my mom and  walked past a man on the ground, and I asked my mom, "Why am I here and why is he there?" It was a naive question. As a child, I just wanted to people to be happy and equal. It's a world I still strive for.

## Team
This project started with Donald Swen, Eleanor Glockner, Casey Prohaska, & Kate Slunkova. Eleanor and I brought on Malaika Koshy and Alyssa Li to then drive the project towards completion over the summer.

## Real World Impact
Today the digital kiosk is used by five shelters, serving 500 users daily per day. We designed a scalable, low cost solution for a nonprofit alongside the most vulnerable of populations.

## Gratitude
This project would not be possible with the generous support and funding by Stanford's Design for Extreme Affordability. In addition, we thank our mentors for their critique and guidance: David Kelley, Bill Burnett, Stuart Coulson, Manasa Yeturu, Nell Garcia, George Toye, Rosanne Foust, Michelle Jia, Michael Barry, & Julie Stanford.
