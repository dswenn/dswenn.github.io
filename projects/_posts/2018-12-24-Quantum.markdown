The applications for nanobeams lie in quantum communication networks. Current communication networks process information using microwave light (gigahertz frequency) in their microprocessors and distribute information over long distances through optical fibers using terahertz (THz) frequencies. Recent advancements has also allowed for superconducting qubits to operate at microwave frequencies. The parallel would be to distribute information also through optical fibers using terahertz frequencies, allowing for the creation of a quantum network. However, no such transducer currently exists. Using microwave frequencies to distribute information would be impractical for quantum devices and would require low loss, superconducting transmission lines. Optomechanical nanobeams offers a promising solution to convert between microwave and optical frequencies to enable quantum networks.

With MATLAB and COMSOL physics simulation software, the existing library of scripts was expanded and an optimization script was written incorporating crystal symmetry and custom meshing that found a nanobeam with high quality and optomechanical coupling factors. The final nanobeam was 13 tapered cells with a slotted center.

This three month project was conducted under the guidance of Dr. Matthias Wulf, PhD candidate Georg Arnold, and Dr. Johannes Fink in the [Fink group](https://quantumids.com/) at the Institute of Science & Technology - Austria. Funding was made possible through the ISTernship program at IST.
