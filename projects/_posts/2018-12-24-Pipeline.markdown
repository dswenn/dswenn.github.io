When I joined Engineers without Borders, the project was four years old. The brief was to create a water distribution system for two villages, 370 people, in a remote region of Morocco. Previous university students had drilled a well, installed a pump, and installed 1.4 km of 2" steel pipe. However, the project stagnated in the past two years. The costs of completing the six kilometer pipeline with steel pipe would have costed $60,000 alone. Worse, the steel pipeline leaked to varying degrees every couple of joints.

In late August of 2019, water reached the first village. In six weeks time, we gained the trust of the community and worked with them to construct a 38,000 L reinforced concrete tank, a solar rack holding 20 solar panels, four tapstands, installed a solar controller, and laid four km of PE100 pipe. We raised over $50,000 of sponsorship in cash and materials to carry out the project. Today, life is different for the community of Ilguilouda, and soon for Izgouaren.

This post will be a detailed view into the process of how a group of college students accomplished a working water distribution system.
