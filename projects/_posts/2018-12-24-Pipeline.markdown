Ait Bayoud is a series of villages in an impoverished region of Morocco. Two villages, Izgouaren and Ilguilouda, in particular experience water scarcity due to their remote location. Residents, primarily women and children, walk for three to four hours per day to collect water from neighbouring communities and distant springs. Access to a sustainable water supply is vital to the growth and progress of these communities.

See press on our project: [McElroy](http://press.mcelroy.com/pipeline-delivers-water-hope-to-remote-moroccan-village/) & [Water for the World](https://www.waterfortheworld.net/projects/providing-life-changing-safe-water-supply-to-rural-villages-in-morocco).

In late August of 2019, water reached the first village of Ilguilouda. In six weeks time, we gained the trust of the community and worked with them to construct a 38,000 L reinforced concrete tank, a solar rack holding 20 solar panels, four tapstands, installed a solar controller, and laid four km of PE100 pipe. My role was in leading the technical designs and raising over $43,000 of sponsorship in cash and materials to carry out the project. Today, life is different for the community of Ilguilouda, and soon for Izgouaren.

## Implementation

Izgouaren and Ilguilouda are two communities out of the 700 million people in the world that live in water scarcity. Let's press forward in our efforts to do good.
