Research @ Columbia University | 2019

As an independent project carried out under the guidance of Professor Shiho Kawashima and Dr. Siwei Ma with Australian colloborator, Dr. Arnaud Castel of UNSW, I did rheology research on a sustainable cement called geopolymer.

As demos for our senior design expo, I casted busts of Professor Kawashima and Dr. Ma. They double as gifts to them as gratitude for their valuable guidance and support.

Heads were 3D scanned using Heges.

Scanned .stl files were cleaned and edited using Autodesk Meshmixer and imported into Fusion360.

A negative was made using Fusion360.

Molds were 3D printed using PLA using Ultimaker Extended 2+.

Prior to casting, molds were machined using a bandsaw to help with demolding. Removed parts were recreated using modeling clay. WD-40 was sprayed for removal ease. Molds were clamped.

A 25% fly ash / 75% slag geopolymer cement was mixed in ASTM mixer, and casted immediately.

Due to the rigidity of PLA, a heat gun was used at one point and then further machined and chiseled. Epoxy and modeling clay was used for segments that did not cure properly.
