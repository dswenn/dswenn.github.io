Design Student @ Stanford University | 2022

I'm a teaching assistant for the Product Realization Lab at Stanford University, where I help hundreds of students each year realize their ideas. I also design physical and electronic products. This is a short sample of the types of products I've worked on.

## The Stack
A polyrhythmic beat machine. Create beats with a turn of a dial. Inspired by my interest in house music.

## The Retro Nixie
A retro inspired Soviet era Nixie Tube Clock. I'm currently working on a new iteration (includes a custom PCB) with my friend Rony Ballouz.

## CAD Work
A slideshow showing some CAD design work I've done. Work includes portable coffee canister, GoPro mounts, Japanese inspired coffee cup, manual grasper for arthroscopic surgery, and an injection molded electric scooter for kids.

## The Cube
What if we made a giant cube? With 12 planks of wood, two friends and I set out to make a giant 7’ x 7’ cube. A spur of the moment activity, play for play’s sake. It has now become an interactive, iterative, co-creative icon of the Loft community.
