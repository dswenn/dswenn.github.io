Design Student @ Stanford University | 2022

I'm a teaching assistant for the Product Realization Lab at Stanford University, where I help hundreds of students each year realize their ideas. I also design physical and electronic products. This is a short sample of the types of products I've worked on.

This page is a work in progress.

## The Stack
A polyrhythmic beat machine. Create beats with a turn of a dial. Inspired by my interest in house music.

## The Retro Nixie
A retro inspired Soviet era Nixie Tube Clock. I'm currently working on a new iteration (includes a custom PCB) with my friend Rony Ballouz.

## The Cube
What if we made a giant cube? With 12 planks of wood, two friends and I set out to make a giant 7’ x 7’ cube. A spur of the moment activity, play for play’s sake. It has now become an interactive, iterative, co-creative icon of the Loft community.
