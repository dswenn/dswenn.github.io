<p><em>Introduction</em> July 13th, 2015<br/>
            <br/>
            <textarea rows="10" cols="50" disabled>
I love reading. But reading is hard. Often times I read through a page of a book, and look up with an expression of bewilderment, "What Just happened!?"

And after multiple times of re-reading, I finally start to understand what the author is talking about. Usually I have a grin that expresses,"That's right! I get you." That experience of understanding where the author and I are on the same wavelength makes reading one my favorite activities to do.

I want to make a reading list of all the books I have read in my spare time starting from 2015 to document the knowledge I learned. I am by no means a good writer nor one of those smart readers who gets everything in one go. I'm really the opposite: slow to understand and can not for the life of me express my thoughts clearly. But I think life is about learning and growing on your weaknesses. So please don't take my thoughts so truthfully! I am forever in a process of changing my thoughts and beliefs for the better so always, if you ever notice something wrong with my thoughts, please correct me.

This blog is mainly for myself, but if you come across any one of these books and you've read them, I would be ecstatic to talk about them with you! Talking with others about the unknown and new ideas is one of my favorite things to do.

My goal is to write book reviews on the books I have read, so that I can look back and remember what I have read. Writing is hard for me, but is incredibly useful to help consolidate ideas and clarify understanding. I will eventually hyperlink the titles to lead to book reviews or summaries of what I learned.

<p><em>Two Books a Month</em> November 28th, 2019<br/>
            <br/>
            <textarea rows="10" cols="50" disabled>
I've graduated and started working full time, which means evenings and weekends are homework and project free. I'm setting a goal to read two books a month. My ambition is however four books a month with short bullet takeaways on each. I'm excited to read the books on my reading list. Ten of the books on the list were recommended to me by my design mentor. The topics cover systems thinking, elements of design thinking, & regenerative cultures. In the next month, I will be finishing the books I started but didn't finish.
