I recently contacted Professor Kleinert asking if I could join her lab research group, and within five minutes of sending the email, she responds saying that I could come in Monday and shadow her and the group! So incredibly stoked for this. 

The focus of the research is the study of ultracold atoms and molecules, with specific emphasis on Rubidium and Calcium. Just the other day I was reading the CMMP journal and came across far-from equilibrium properties and reactions. Can't wait to get started!
