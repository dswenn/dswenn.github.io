This is possibly highly irrelevant to this blog, but I thought I would record the subject of Multivariable calculus. I was never the good student in math, in fact in high school it was one of the subjects that I wanted to love but had so much difficulty doing so. 

For the past three months, I have been taking Professor Otto's Multivariable Calculus, and I possibly discovered a new passion for mathematics. The subject is so incredibly interesting. What engages me is the 3-D modeling instead of just linear, non-applicable to real word, high school calculus. I love imagining the z-axis and forming these seemingly complex graphs in my head that all come together in the end. Perhaps I find these structures just rad. 

Everything is connected in Multi. One section leads to the other, and progression constantly refers back and then expounds to such a grandiose magnitude. I have a great respect for Professor Otto. He teaches without using a sheet of paper, PowerPoint, or anything. Knowledge just pours out of his head, onto the board. I never thought I would consider even the possibility of pursuing a Mathematics minor, but this changes everything. 

There are just so many resources at college. If I don't understand a problem, I can walk into his office and walk out feeling like a little kid that just accomplished something mischievously grand. And then there's the free math tutors; one tutor in particular explains problems so well that all I can say after is "wow". Finally, there's Till, which is this awesome human being that works really hard and is willing to help anyone around her. I really admire her. 

Multivariable Calculus is incredibly rewarding and I can't wait to take more math classes here. There are definitely many possibilities to connect all this theory into practical physics and engineering. Can't wait to do so.
