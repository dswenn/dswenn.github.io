I created this blog following the Udacity course on Web Development. I am still working out data systems so this blog is very temporary and will be going under constant revision, nevertheless it will serve for now. I won't be posting my life on here, however I do wish to start a materials science side-project. The aim of this blog will thus be to document an exploration into materials science engineering. I think it's going to be exciting.
