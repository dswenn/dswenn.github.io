Today, I sat down with my physics professor and talked about science related opportunities in the summer. She tells me that there exists SERP, which is a science research grant program. Unfortunately she will be retiring, as thus I will have to find another professor for mentorship, which might prove to be rather challenging. Nevertheless, one must never give up on this long journey. 

Also I thought I might share this rather interesting thing that happened to me today. While reading Rosa Luxemburg, I found a quote that strongly resonates with my current stage of life: “We have to take everything as it comes both in social life and in private life to accept what happens, tranquilly, comprehensively, and with a smile.” Mind you, she wrote this in a prison! If she can be intoxicated with bliss and happiness while incarcerated, then I should strive toward that. Alright, till next time.
